# flutter_concepts_sample_project

This project is cloned from a udemy course by "Academind by Maximilian Schwarzmüller Maximilian Schwarzmüller"

The changes done by me are the following.
1.)Added comments everywhere to provide brief explanation of the things.
2.)Changed the UI
3.)Instead of using dynamic themes as was in the original project, I defined the custom color and text theme.
4.)Also used the generator classes for avoiding the typo mistakes for colors and fonts.
